Description: Go client for AMQP 0.9.1 (library)
 This is a Go AMQP 0.9.1 client maintained by the RabbitMQ core team.
 It was originally developed by Sean Treadway.
 .
 The library provides a functional interface that closely represents
 the AMQP 0.9.1 model targeted to RabbitMQ as a server. This includes
 the minimum necessary to interact the semantics of the protocol.
